(from opencv docs)
Otsu's binarization automatically calculates a threshold value from image
histogram for a bimodal image. (For images which are not bimodal, binarization
wonâ€™t be accurate.)
For this, cv2.threshold() function is used with an extra flag, cv2.THRESH_OTSU.
For threshold value, simply pass zero. Then the algorithm finds the optimal
threshold value and returns you as the second output. If Otsu thresholding is
not used, the optimal threshold is same as the threshold value you used.
